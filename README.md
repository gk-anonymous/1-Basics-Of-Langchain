# 🧠 LangChain - Complete Basics to Advanced (End-to-End Guide)

This repository is a comprehensive guide to learning **LangChain** from scratch. It is organized module-wise to help you understand all the core concepts required to build powerful LLM applications using LangChain.

---

## 📚 What is LangChain?

LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It helps developers connect LLMs with external data, memory, tools, and agents.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/langchain-basics-end-to-end.git
cd langchain-basics-end-to-end
````

2. **Create a virtual environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🚀 How to Use Each Folder

Each folder contains:

* ✅ A Python script demonstrating a concept
* 📄 Sample files (PDFs, text)
* 📝 Code comments explaining the logic

You can run them directly:

```bash
cd 3.1-document_loader
python load_pdf.py
```

---

## 🧪 Example Use Case

**📄 Input PDF**: research.pdf
**💬 Question**: “What is the summary of this document?”
**🤖 Output**: A GPT-generated summary based on your local PDF using vector retrieval.

---

## 🔗 Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* LangChain >= 0.1.x
* OpenAI / Ollama installed
* FAISS or Chroma for vector search

---

## 📦 Recommended Libraries

* `langchain`
* `openai`
* `chromadb` / `faiss-cpu`
* `python-dotenv`
* `PyPDF2`, `bs4` (for loading documents)
* `tqdm`, `streamlit` (optional UI)
